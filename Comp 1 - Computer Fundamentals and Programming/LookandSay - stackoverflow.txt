Required output

Sample Input :

Sample Output:

my code is here

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char *a = malloc(2), *b = 0, *x, c;
    int cnt, len = 1,i=1,lim,s;
  scanf("%d",&s);
 scanf("%d",&lim);
    for (sprintf(a, "%d",s); (b = realloc(b, len * 2 + 1)); a = b, b = x)
    {
        puts(x = a);
        for (len = 0, cnt = 1; (c = *a); )
        {
            if (c == *++a)
                cnt++;
            else if (c) 
            {
                len += sprintf(b + len, "%d%c", cnt, c);
                cnt = 1;

            }

        }

with all due respect and benefit of the doubt (ths could be an exercise in C coding): the code looks a tad complicated (mind you I love pointers and dynamic code). Do you understand the overhead of memory allocation (and re-allocation)? – Pynchia Jul 2 at 12:58

puts automatically appends a newline. If that's not what you want, you can fputs your string to stdout or use printf.
 fputs(x=a,stdout);
or

 printf("%s ",a);

Use

 printf("%s ",a);
instead of

 puts(x = a);
